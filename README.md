[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

[Requesty](https://requesty.ai/) is a platform that provides access to various AI models through a unified API.

## Features

-   Interact with multiple AI models through a single node
-   Send chat messages to AI models
-   Customize model parameters such as temperature, max tokens, frequency penalty, and presence penalty
-   View truncated model descriptions and pricing information in the model selector
-   Easy integration with n8n workflows

## Installation

### Community Node (Recommended)

To install this node as a community node in n8n, follow these steps:

1. Open your n8n instance
2. Go to "Settings" > "Community Nodes"
3. Select "Install"
4. Enter `n8n-requesty` in the "Enter npm package name" field
5. Agree to the risks of using community nodes (if prompted)
6. Click "Install"

After installation, the node will be available in the "Requesty" category in the node palette.

### Manual Installation (Advanced)

If you prefer manual installation or are using a custom n8n setup:

1. Open your n8n installation directory
2. Navigate to the `nodes` subdirectory
3. Run the following command:
    ```
    npm install n8n-nodes-requesty
    ```
4. Restart your n8n instance

**Note:** If you're using Docker or a server deployment, you may need to rebuild your container or restart your server for the changes to take effect.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the node not updating to new versions correctly or not displaying changes inside n8n, try the following:

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Restart your n8n instance
3. If using Docker, rebuild and restart your container:
    ```
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
4. For server deployments, restart the n8n service:
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart n8n
    ```

## Usage

1. Add the Requesty node to your workflow
2. Configure the Requesty API credentials (see Configuration section)
3. Select the desired operation (currently only 'Chat' is available)
4. Choose an AI model from the dropdown list
5. (Optional) Provide a system prompt to set the behavior of the AI
6. Enter your message
7. Adjust additional parameters as needed (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
8. Execute the node to receive the AI's response

## Model Selection

The model selector provides truncated descriptions of each available model along with pricing information. The pricing is displayed as cost per 1 million tokens for both prompt and completion. This allows you to make informed decisions about which model to use based on capabilities and cost.

## Configuration

### Requesty API Credentials

To use this node, you need to set up Requesty API credentials:

1. Sign up for an account at [Requesty](https://app.requesty.ai/sign-up)
2. Generate an API key at [Getting Started](https://app.requesty.ai/getting-started)
3. In n8n, create a new credential of type 'Requesty API'
4. Enter your API key

### Node Parameters

-   **Operation**: Currently, only 'Chat' is available
-   **Model**: Select the AI model you want to use
-   **System Prompt**: (Optional) Set the behavior or role of the AI assistant
-   **Message**: The user's input message to the AI
-   **Temperature**: Controls the randomness of the AI's output (0.0 to 1.0)
-   **Additional Fields**:
    -   **Frequency Penalty**: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far.
    -   **Max Tokens**: The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion.
    -   **Presence Penalty**: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far.
    -   **Top P**: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling. Top_p of 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

## Examples

### Basic Chat Workflow

1. Add a "Manual" trigger node
2. Connect a Requesty node
3. Configure the Requesty node:
    - Operation: Chat
    - Model: Choose a model (e.g., "gpt-3.5-turbo")
    - Message: "Hello, can you explain what n8n is?"
4. Execute the workflow
5. The Requesty node will return the AI's response explaining n8n

### Dynamic System Prompt

1. Start with a "Manual" trigger node
2. Add a "Set" node to define a variable for the system prompt
3. Connect a Requesty node
4. Configure the Requesty node:
    - Operation: Chat
    - Model: Choose a model
    - System Prompt: {{$node["Set"].json["systemPrompt"]}}
    - Message: "What's your primary function?"
5. Execute the workflow
6. The AI will respond based on the system prompt set in the "Set" node
